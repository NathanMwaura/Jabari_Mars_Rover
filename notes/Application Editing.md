Process for Creating a New Feature
To create a new feature, such as a "last command" display, you would follow the established pattern of componentization, state management, and communication.

Create a New Svelte Component:

Create a new file, for example, LastCommand.svelte, inside the web_app/src/lib/components/ directory.
This file will contain the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic for displaying the last command.
Add a New State Store:

Open the state management file, web_app/src/lib/stores.js.
Add a new writable store to hold the last command data. For example:
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
// ... other stores
export const lastCommand = writable('');

javascript


Update the Communication Service:

Modify the ROS WebSocket service at web_app/src/lib/services/ros-websocket.js.
Update the service to import the new lastCommand store and update its value whenever a command is sent to the robot.
Integrate the Component into the Application:

Open the main application component, web_app/src/App.svelte.
Import the new LastCommand.svelte component.
Place the component's tag (e.g., <LastCommand />) in the desired location within the application's layout. The component will subscribe to the lastCommand store and display the value in real-time.
Process for Editing an Existing Feature
Editing an existing feature involves modifying its component and, if necessary, its associated state and communication logic.

Identify and Modify the Component:

Locate the relevant .svelte component for the feature you wish to edit within the web_app/src/lib/components/ directory (e.g., PanTiltControl.svelte or RobotControl.svelte).
Make the desired changes to the component's structure, style, or logic directly within this file.
Update State Management (if necessary):

If the feature's data requirements change, update the corresponding stores in web_app/src/lib/stores.js.
Update Communication Logic (if necessary):

If the feature needs to send new commands or handle different data from the backend, modify the communication logic within web_app/src/lib/services/ros-websocket.js.
Test the Changes:

As per the README.md, run the Vite development server using npm run dev.
Open the application in your browser to verify that the edits work as expected and have not introduced any regressions.
